## Introduction

This is a code repository for a Realtime Chat Application built using React for the frontend and Node.js with the Socket.io library for the backend. This project demonstrates how to implement real-time communication features, such as sending and receiving messages, using web sockets.

## Features

- Real-time messaging with Socket.io
- Frontend built with React
- Backend powered by Node.js and Socket.io
- Scalable and easy-to-understand codebase

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/realtime-chat-application.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd realtime-chat-application
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both client and server:

   For the server:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

   For the client:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

4. Start both the client and server in separate terminals:

   For the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   For the client:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The development server should now be running, and you can visit the application in your web browser.
